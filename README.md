# Wikipedia Searcher

This program is a simple Wikipedia scraper that allows you to extract basic information about a person from their Wikipedia page.

## Usage

To use this program, simply run the `main.py` script and enter the name of the person you want to search for when prompted. The program will retrieve the corresponding Wikipedia page, extract the relevant information, and display it in the terminal.

The original jupyter notebook `main.ipnyb` can be opened in google colab
